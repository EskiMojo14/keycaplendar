# KeycapLendar

A web app documenting current, future and past keycap GBs, hosted at https://keycaplendar.firebaseapp.com/.

KeycapLendar is built using React Typescript and SCSS for the frontend, and Firebase for the backend. It uses RMWC as a UI framework.

Appreciate what I do and want to support me? Check out my [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/eskimojo)!

## API

API documentation is available on [Stoplight](https://keycaplendar.stoplight.io/docs/keycaplendar/reference/KeycapLendar-API.v1.yaml), created with the help of [@jcsumlin](https://github.com/jcsumlin). In order for an app to use it, an `apiKey` and `apiSecret` must be agreed upon with myself. I am available at `eskimojo#0014` on Discord, or keycaplendar@gmail.com.

## Codebase

Site code is stored in `/src`, and is built by running `npm run build` in the root directory. It compiles into `/public`.

Firebase Functions code is stored in `/functions`, and is built by running `npm run build` within the `/functions` directory. It compiles into `/functions/lib`.

I tend to work alone when developing KeycapLendar, but on rare occasions I have worked with people when developing certain features.
