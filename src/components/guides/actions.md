# Create
To create an entry, click the CREATE button in the bottom right/middle of the screen.

*Designers are only able to create entries with their manually set nickname.*

###### Please contact Eskimojo if you wish for your nickname to be changed, or an editor via the Discord server if a set should have multiple designers.

###### Please note that entries in KeycapLendar should have existing public ICs; ideally on Geekhack, Keebtalk, or Deskthority (though Reddit threads will suffice). KeycapLendar is **not** a place to IC, it is a tracker of ICs and GBs. There is also a minimum requirement of a render/photograph of the keycaps on a board. This is to ensure a consistent look across the site.

# Edit
To edit an entry, select the set and click EDIT in the details drawer. Alternatively, an edit button is available from the card view.

*Designers are only able to edit their own sets, which is verified using their manually set nickname.*

# Delete
To delete an entry, select the set and click **DELETE** in the details drawer. You will then need to confirm this decision in a dialog.

*Designers are not able to delete sets.*

###### Please contact an editor via the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zrcN3qF) if you believe an entry should be deleted.
